# Python Package

This repository **Dist_pyPackage** is a python based package designed with a vision to help the users with difficulties faced in calculation in __*Gaussian*__ and __*Binomial*__ distributions.

## Project files contained:

*general_dis.py :
  contains a generalized __*Distribution*__ class for calculating and visualizing various probability distributions.

*gauss_dis.py :
  contains a __*Gaussian*__ class that inherits the *Distribution* class and classifies for calculation and visualization of Gaussian Distributions.

*bino_dis.py :
  contains a __*Binomial*__ class that inherits the *Distribution* class and classifies for calcultaion and visualization of Binomial Distributions.
